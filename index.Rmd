This portfolio will document the investigation of public school distric financial data. Currently all that has been done is data discovery and preparation, with the other phases coming soon.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

In this first phase we are going to be finding a dataset, and cleaning up the data to make it more suited for statistical analysis.
