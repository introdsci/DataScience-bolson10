## Abstract

This portfolio will document the investigation of public school distric financial data. Using this data, a predictive model was built and tested to assess its accuracy.
  
  
### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

In this first phase we are going to be finding a dataset, and cleaning up the data to make it more suited for statistical analysis.

### 2. Model Planning and Building

After finding some initial data, more is supplemented to create a model to predict a district's ranking.

### 3. Results and Operationalization
